# Simple AutoClicker Example

This is a simple example of an auto-clicker program written in C++ using the Windows API.
The program allows the user to hold down the left mouse button to perform a continuous left-click spam,
and hold down the right mouse button to perform a continuous right-click spam. You can almost inject this into every process.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Jetbrains Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- [Visual Studio 2022 for the Toolchain](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/)
