# Simple AutoClicker Example

This is a simple example of an auto-clicker program written in C++ using the Windows API.
The program allows the user to hold down the left mouse button to perform a continuous left-click spam,
and hold down the right mouse button to perform a continuous right-click spam. You can almost inject this into every process.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Clion (https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- Visual Studio 2022 for the Toolchain (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/)

### On the Visual Studio 2022 Installation u need to choose Following individual installations
#### Workloads:
- Universal Windows Platform development 

#### Individual:
- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.38-17.8)
- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)
- Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)
- C++ CMake tools for Windows

Once you have Clion and the parts above installed, go in Clion u might download some Plugins you know from IntelliJ because they may be on Clion also.
Then go in the settings and add a new "Toolchain" under "Build, Execution, Deployment" click on the "+" then select 
"Visual Studio" and select your installation path. Then right under "Toolchains" is "CMake" and click twice on the "+" until "Debug" and "Release"
shows up. Click on "Release" and make sure the "Toolchain" is selected to "Visual Studio"
